Chisel is a code generator built on [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io). The goal of chisel is to make scaffolding new applications  much faster. 

Supported applications include:

 - Standalone library
 - Express (TODO)
 - Restify (TODO)

## Getting Started

If you don't already have Yeoman installed, then install it from npm. 

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install Chisel (generator-chisel) from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-chisel
```

Next create a directory for you project and run the Chisel generator:

```
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ yo chisel
```
